**Deadlock Solver:**

This Deadlock Solver application is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool built with Python's Tkinter library to help visualize and solve deadlock scenarios using the Banker's Algorithm. The application allows users to input processes, resources, and their respective allocations and maximum requirements. It then calculates whether a safe sequence exists to avoid a deadlock, displaying results accordingly.

**Features**
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive GUI for inputting and managing resources, allocations, and maximum requirements.
Dynamic Calculation: Supports user-defined numbers of processes and resource types.
Matrix Display: Shows Allocation, Max Resource, and Need matrices for easy understanding.
Deadlock Detection: Identifies and displays a safe sequence if one exists, or indicates if a deadlock is detected.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (included with Python's standard library)

Running the Application
1.Run the main script:
     python deadlock_solver.py
2.Enter the number of processes, resource types, allocated resources, maximum resource requirements, and available resources through the GUI prompts.
3.After entering all data, the application will display the allocation, maximum resource, and need matrices, followed by the deadlock results.

Usage
1. Run Solver: Click the "Run Solver" button to start inputting data.
2. Solve Another Deadlock: After each result, choose to solve another deadlock or exit.
